<body background="images/banner.jpg">We gain strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. These guidelines exist to ensure that diverse groups collaborate for mutual advantage and enjoyment. We challenge prejudice that jeopardises participation of any person in the project.

/><br
/><br
/>1) Expected Behavior<br
/><br
/>The following behaviors are expected and requested of all participants, including attendees, speakers, and staff:<br
/><br
/>Lead by Example<br
/><br
/>Each individual attending this event&nbsp; does so on behalf of their community. This means being considerate of&nbsp; how your discussions, actions, and decisions will represent your community.<br
/><br
/>Be Respectful<br
/><br
/>Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We will exercise consideration and respect in our speech and actions, and consider collaboration before conflict.&nbsp; Ensure all voices are heard, not just the loudest.<br
/><br
/>Watch your language<br
/><br
/>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. This includes gestures and online discussions / back-channels (like Telegram).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Take responsibility for our words &amp; actions<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>We all make mistakes. When we do, we take responsibility for them.&nbsp; If someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully, and work to right the wrong.<br
/><br
/>Look out for each other<br
/><br
/>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert an event organizer if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of these guidelines. If something makes you feel concerned or worried—even if you’re not sure it’s a violation—it’s better to reach out than to ignore it.<br
/><br
/>Be mindful of local laws. Protect each other from publicizing personal information that may put people at risk<br
/><br
/>Remember that event venues may be shared with members of the public. Please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.<br
/><br
/>Expect and accommodate cultural&nbsp; and personal differences<br
/><br
/>Be mindful that for many, English is a second, third, or even fourth language. Show patience and respect while listening to and conveying ideas. Remember that we come from many cultures and backgrounds. What is friendly in one culture may not be in another. If you’re not sure what is appropriate, just ask.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Remember that due to personal, religious, or other reasons, not everyone in the group may drink alcohol or even eat certain types of food. Please respect people’s choices and preferences in this regard without question or criticism.<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Ask for help&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Everyone is encouraged to ask questions about these guidelines and the Participation Guidelines generally.<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>2) Unacceptable Behavior<br
/><br
/><br
/>The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable:<br
/><br
/>Violence and threat of violence<br
/><br
/>This includes incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouragement to commit self-harm.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>This includes posting or threatening to post other people’s personally-identifying information ("doxing").<br
/><br
/>Derogatory language<br
/><br
/>Hurtful or harmful language related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, age, or socio-economic status.&nbsp;&nbsp; This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they clearly do not identify with.<br
/><br
/>&nbsp;If you’re unsure if a word is derogatory, don’t use it.<br
/><br
/>Sexual behavior<br
/><br
/>Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes, inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances, physical contact or simulated physical contact (e.g. textual messages like “hug” or “backrub”) without affirmative consent.&nbsp;&nbsp; This includes sharing or distribution of sexualized images.<br
/><br
/>Of course, you can hug your best friend that you've known forever - the key word is <em>consent</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Disruptive behavior<br
/><br
/>Sustained disruption of summit events, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated.&nbsp; This includes "talking over" speakers or influencing crowd actions that are contrary to the direction of the session.<br
/><br
/>Over-consumption of alcohol or making derogatory comments about those who abstain from alcohol.<br
/><br
/>Instigating<br
/><br
/>Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors are the same as committing that behavior yourself, and thus, the same consequences apply.<br
/><br
/>3) Consequences of unacceptable behavior<br
/><br
/><br
/>Unacceptable behavior from any summit community participants, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.<br
/><br
/>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.<br
/><br
/>If an event participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the event, as well as associated and future events without warning.<br
/><br
/>4) Reporting guidelines<br
/><br
/><br
/>If you are subject to, witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the Summit Conduct Team as soon as possible by emailing sumukher@redhat.com.<br
/><br
/>Additionally, event organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.<br
/><br
/>5) Addressing grievances<br
/><br
/><br
/>If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Guideline, you should notify sumukher@redhat.com<br
/>with a concise description of your grievance.<br
/>6) Scope<br
/><br
/><br
/>All participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; contractors; and other guests) are expected to abide by these guidelines in all community venues, online and in-person, as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.<br
/><br
/>These guidelines and related procedures also apply to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when it has potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.<br
